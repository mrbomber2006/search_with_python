This Python code allows the user to search for a phrase on Google and open the top results in a web browser. The user can also choose to save the search results to a text file.

The code first imports the googlesearch and webbrowser modules. Then, it prompts the user to enter a phrase to search for and the number of results to display. The code then uses the search() function from the googlesearch module to search for the phrase and returns a list of results. The code then prints the results to the console and prompts the user to open the pages in a web browser. If the user chooses to open the pages, the code uses the webbrowser module to open the pages in new tabs. If the user chooses not to open the pages, the code saves the results to a text file called search_results.txt.
